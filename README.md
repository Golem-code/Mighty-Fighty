Mighty Fighty is my first fully-functional game made from scratch with python, so I don't really know if I've done anything wrong.
It is a text-based 'mini-game' built primarily on loops, functions, and randomness.
In the beginning, the code generates a random name, hp, attack, and gold.
Gold and xp is then gained in 'fights' in which a random enemy is generated with random stats.
You can use the gold to go to the shop and buy health, potions, attack, xp and upgrades.
When enough xp is gained, an upgrade is available, along with more features such as the oracle, quickfights, and medium difficulty fights.
The game finishes at level 4.
I have put almost everything into a function so that it is easier to organize, even though it would make no more code to no have any functions.
